# **Savya Robotics SR-L6 6-DoF Robot Arm**

The **Savya Robotics SR-L6** is a versatile **6-DoF robotic arm** designed for use in various applications including industrial automation, research, and education. With its compact and modular design, the SR-L6 is ideal for tasks that require precision and flexibility, such as **pick-and-place**, **assembly**, and **object manipulation**. It is equipped with high-precision motors and is controlled via an intuitive interface, often using **ROS (Robot Operating System)** for motion planning and control.

The SR-L6 robotic arm offers **6 degrees of freedom (DoF)**, allowing it to move along multiple axes for complex operations. Its design is optimized for **high precision**, making it suitable for applications that require repeatability and accuracy.

## **Limitations**
1. **Payload Capacity:**
   - The SR-L6 can handle moderate payloads, typically up to **5 kg**. It may not be suitable for heavy-duty industrial applications that require moving larger loads.

2. **Reach:**
   - The robot arm has a **limited reach** of 500 mm to 900 mm, which may not be sufficient for larger workspaces or tasks requiring a broader range.

3. **Speed:**
   - While the SR-L6 is fairly quick for small to medium-scale applications, it is not as fast as more industrial-grade robotic arms designed for high-speed operations.

4. **Precision:**
   - The SR-L6 offers high precision for tasks like assembly and testing, but may not provide the extreme precision needed for **nano-scale** or ultra-fine manufacturing tasks.

5. **Environment:**
   - The SR-L6 is best suited for controlled environments, and its performance might degrade in extreme conditions such as high heat, moisture, or dust.
